## Task 1

### Question

Design a class diagram using the following problem statement:

**Estate Agency**

An estate agency deals with the buying and selling of properties. Each property is only dealt with at one
branch. Details on employees employed at each branch, together with information on the manager of that
branch need to be kept. In addition, information needs to be retained re: properties, property sellers and
potential buyers.

Most properties are assigned to a particular member of staff but a staff member can only handle a
maximum of 20 properties at any one time. Details are recorded on each client and on each property they
wish to sell. Details are also kept with regard to those customers who are interested in buying a property,
together with a (very) simplified set of requirements.

---

- Do not include attributes or operations.
- With OO system design principles in mind, in addition to association, can you think of any other relevant class relationships that could be included? For example, is there any scope for showing inheritance – (i.e. generalisation/specialisation – superclasses/subclasses), aggregation, and/or composition?
- State any assumptions made.

## Task 2

### Question

Design a class diagram using the following problem statement:

**University**

A University offers a number of courses. Very simplistically, each course is supervised by a lecturer and a
lecturer can supervise a number of courses. A course can be dealt with by a number of administrative staff
and administrative staff will deal with a number of different courses. Each course can be studied by a
number of students. Students can be part-time or full-time. Part-time students pay their own fees whereas
most full-time students have part of their fees paid by their Local Education Authority (LEA). LEA details
need to be recorded in order to invoice them for fees owed.

---

- Do not include attributes or operations.
- Include inheritance relationships (i.e. generalisation/specialisation in your model.
